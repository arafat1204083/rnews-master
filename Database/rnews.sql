(13, 'The novel opens at Longbourn, the Bennet family''s estate.', '  The story centers on the the Bennet family, particularly Elizabeth. The novel opens at Longbourn, the\r\nBennet family''s estate. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five children: Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia.\r\nThe family engages in a conversation about Mr. Bingley, "a single man of large fortune" who will be\r\nrenting the nearby estate of Netherfield Park. Mrs. Bennet sees Mr. Bingley as a potential suitor for one\r\nof her daughters.\r\nThe Bennets first meet Mr. Bingley and his companions at the Meryton Ball. The townspeople conclude\r\nthat Mr. Bingley is perfectly amiable and agreeable. Meanwhile, Mr. Bingley takes an immediate liking to\r\nJane Bennet. Mr. Bingley''s friend Mr. Darcy, however, snubs Elizabeth. The community decides that\r\nDarcy is proud and disagreeable because of his reserve and his refusal to dance. Jane finds Bingley''s\r\nsisters - Caroline and Mrs. Hurst - to be amiable, but Elizabeth sees them as arrogant.\r\nAfter further interactions, it becomes evident that Jane and Bingley are interested in one another.\r\nHowever, while Bingley makes his partiality quite obvious, Jane is universally cheerful and somewhat\r\nshy. Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth''s best friend, has a very pragmatic view of marriage. She recommends\r\nthat Jane make her regard for Bingley more obvious. At the same time, Mr. Darcy begins to admire\r\nElizabeth, captivated by her fine eyes and lively wit. She, however, remains contemptuous towards him.\r\nWhen Jane is invited for dinner at Netherfield, Mrs. Bennet refuses to provide her with a carriage,\r\nhoping that the impending rainstorm will force her to spend the night there. After getting caught in the\r\nrain, Jane actually falls ill and has to remain at Netherfield for many days. Upon hearing that Jane is ill,\r\nElizabeth walks to Bingley''s estate through the muddy fields. Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst are\r\nscandalized by Elizabeth''s rumpled appearance, but join Bingley in welcoming her nonetheless.\r\nElizabeth continues to impress Darcy during her time nursing Jane at Netherfield. However, she remains\r\nblind to his affections and continues to see him as a proud and haughty man. Caroline, who hopes to\r\nattract Mr. Darcy herself, grows extremely jealous of Elizabeth and mocks her lowly status.\r\nMrs. Bennet and her younger daughters come to Netherfield to check on Jane, and Elizabeth is\r\nmortified by their foolish behavior and complete lack of manners.
